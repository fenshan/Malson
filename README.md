<h3 align="center">GGJ 2019 game. What does home mean to you?</h3>
<p align="center">
  In Malson, you play as a young person who feels alienated in their own home. Walk through the procedurally 
  <br>
  generated house to get through each day. Each day lasts as long as the main music track. Use WASD
  <br>
  to move and E to interact with doors and the different objectives. Headphones are strongly recommended.
