# MALSON
GGJ 2019

In Malson, you play as a young person who feels alienated in their own home. Walk through the procedurally generated house to get through each day.Each day lasts as long as the main music track. Use WASD to move and E to interact with doors and the different objectives. Headphones are strongly recommended.
